      "Our research shows that knowledge of experts is not semantically different, but rather that information is more connected between each other. The conducted experiments demonstrated that the size of the words and retrieval speed of words from memory varies between people with different background knowledge. The findings of our study could also help to give better, personalized instructions to the users in different fields, and help with the construction of a more interactive dialog between the user and an intelligent tutoring system."
